This zig code is based on work of Alexandre Becoulet whose c-code source
files are found at: https://github.com/diaxen/fft-garden.  

The name of this zig-code repo "fft-orchard" is deliberately chosen to be
similar in name as an acknowledgement to the original.

The original fft_garden code is an initial work as part of a published
paper "A Depth-First Iterative Algorithm for the Conjugate Pair Fast Fourier
Transform" (available at: https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/A_Depth-First_Iterative_Algorithm_for_the_Conjugate_Pair_Fast_Fourier_Transform/13489392)

For the fft algorithm files, the naming of the zig source files reflects the naming
of the original c-code files.  The names consist of 3 parts (and a 4th optional part):

BUTTERFLY DESIGN:

   ct - cooley-tukey radix-2 fft
   mr - mixed radix 2/4 fft
   sr - split radix fft
   cp - conjugate pair fft

DECIMATION:

   dit - decimation in time
   dif - decimation in freq

TRAVERSAL & ALGORITHM STRUCTURE:

   bi - breadth-first iterative
   dr - depth-first recursive
   di - depth-first iterative

OPTIONAL ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES:

   G - butterflies use same twiddles grouped by stage
   S - butterflies use same twiddles grouped by block
   L - input reordering and/or butterfly scheduling may rely on lookup tables
   P - butterfly functions may be simplified from some twiddle factor values
   F - twiddle table may be reduced to N/8 entries
   N - algorithm made to work in-place
